This site is made in Vue.js. I use Vuex to keep a global state and the gallery is made from scratch. I decided to use Tailwind.css for the layout.

## Features

+ Loads and displays projects fron a json file.
+ Automatically switches theme based on the time of day.
+ Changing a project actually only changes the content and forces an animation to display.
